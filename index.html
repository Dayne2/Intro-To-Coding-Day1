        <h2>Breve Description and Interesting Facts of The Common Raven (<i>Corvus corax</i>)</h2>
        <p>The Common Raven (<i>Corvus corax</i>) is a large all-black passerine bird. It is the most widely distributed of all corvids, 
            found across the Northern Hemisphere. It is a raven known by many names at the subspecies level; there are at least eight 
            subspecies. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is possibly the heaviest passerine 
            bird; at maturity, the common raven averages 63 centimeters (25 inches) in length and 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds) in mass. 
            Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, common ravens can live more than 23 years in the wild.</p>

            <p>Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life, with each mated pair defending a territory. Part of their success 
            as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition,
            feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, nesting birds, and food waste. Adept scavengers, 
            Common Ravens are often associated with large carnivores, especially wolves. Still, their resourcefulness and wide range of 
            potential food items have allowed them to thrive in nearly every available habitat within their range, from urban 
            garbage dumps to deep rainforests and high alpine tundra.</p>
            
            
            <p>Over the centuries, the raven has been the subject of mythology, folklore, art, and literature. In many cultures, including the 
            indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and Siberia and northeast
            Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or godlike creature. The brain of the common raven is among the largest 
            of any bird species. Specifically, their hyperpallium is large for a bird. They display ability in problem-solving, as well as other 
            cognitive processes such as imitation and insight, and possess a highly complex social system.</p>
    

            <p>The world's largest songbird, its glossy black plumage, guttural voice, famous intellect, and abundant presence in symbolism and 
            culture make it one of British Columbia's most intriguing and recognizable species. The Raven has been celebrated by cultures across 
            its range, and for many First Nations in British Columbia, the Raven is of particular cultural importance.
